# Flask Cupcakes Exercise

A simple Flask application for managing a collection of cupcakes, built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Bootstrap. Users can view, add, and (optionally) delete cupcakes through a responsive interface. The project demonstrates RESTful API design, AJAX form handling, and dynamic UI updates.

This app practices using full-stack web development concepts with Python and JavaScript.
